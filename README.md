# Mybrary

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

## Project Outline

This is currently a project in progress for my front-end development course through Launchcode. This app is meant to provide a means for users to list and lend their own books, music albums, movies, and/or zines to other users. Users will be able to create a personal account, list and display personal items they're willing to lend out, browse other users' collections, and arrange means of lending items to eachother through the app.
